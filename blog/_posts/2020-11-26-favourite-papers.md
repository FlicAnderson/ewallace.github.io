This blogpost has been created as part of a lab workshop on using [git version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) and has been a great excuse to share and discuss interesting papers that have influenced our work!

### Bioinformatics Papers

*Flic Anderson:*

["Best Practices for Scientific Computing"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745) pulls together ideas for how to produce readable, shareable code that will deliver reliable results worth publishing. It's informed by the authors' involvement in the [Carpentries Organisation](https://carpentries.org/) and it's inspired me to train as a Carpentries Instructor to help teach [data and software workshops](https://edcarp.github.io/) as well as using the skills day to day in my developer work on [riboviz](https://github.com/riboviz/riboviz).
