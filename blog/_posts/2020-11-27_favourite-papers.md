# Bioinformatics Papers

["Best Practices for Scientific Computing"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745) is a great paper that has been a huge part of my current role as *Research Assistant in Bioinformatics* as part of the lab. The paper pulls together some key recommendations and principles for how to make the most of your scientific work - from how to manage your data better to avoid headaches later on, to how to write 'programs for people' and how to produce robust, readable, shareable code that will deliver reliable results worth publishing. It's a laundry-list of sensible ideas and tips which would benefit most scientists and programmers, and is informed by the authors' involvement in the [Carpentries Organisation](https://carpentries.org/) - teaching practical skills in [data](https://datacarpentry.org/lessons/) and [software development](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/) aimed at researchers, but useful for a wide range of folks looking to build a foundation for further learning in coding and data-heavy topics. I really admire the pragmatic approach, and it's inspired me to train as a Carpentries Instructor to help teach [workshops](https://edcarp.github.io/) to show others how to adopt these best practices and improve their research by learning these skills.
