# Inclusivity Statement

At the Wallace Lab we believe in equity, diversity, and inclusion in science. We believe in the importance of a safe and equal environment for all. Therefore, we as a lab are strongly against any form of racism, homophobia, transphobia, misogyny, ableism, or discrimination based on religion. We strive to support our colleagues as best we can, to amplify the voices of BAME and LGBT+ minorities, and to speak up when needed. In addition to this, we support our lab members with caring duties or dependents by offering a safe work environment and flexible work hours. We are in on-going pursuit of open conversation and accountability, to be better colleagues and to make science more accessible for everyone.
